# REST API reference

This reference is for client developers and integrators. After reading it, you can find the local API base URL, response format, auth headers, resource endpoints, session endpoints, and artifact endpoints.

Default service address:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

## General conventions

Most JSON endpoints return an envelope:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {}
}
```

Error responses:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "resource not found"
  }
}
```

File downloads and artifact downloads return binary responses; upload endpoints use `multipart/form-data`.

## Identity and auth

Local development supports these headers:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <dev_token>
X-Dev-Token: <dev_token>
X-Workspace-Id: default
```

When headers are omitted, the backend uses the development default identity and default workspace. Web v1 does not expose workspace switching; use `default` unless you are building an integration that owns workspace routing.

For local user isolation, send the same identity headers to both `/api/v1/*` REST calls and `POST /api/copilotkit`. If the two channels use different headers, sessions, resources, files, artifacts, and run events can appear under different users.

Password mode uses session cookies and CSRF:

```text
DATAFOUNDRY_AUTH_MODE=password
X-CSRF-Token: <token_from_df_csrf_cookie>
```

Use `DATAFOUNDRY_AUTH_MODE=dev` only for contributor hot-reload. Formal test and real production default to `password` unless overridden.

## Identity endpoints

| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/me` | Read the current user and workspace. |
| GET | `/api/v1/dev/identities` | List local development users. Disabled in production by default. |
| POST | `/api/v1/dev/users` | Create or update a local development user. Disabled in production by default. |

## Password auth endpoints

These endpoints are enabled when password auth mode is active:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/register` | Create a user account and verification token. |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/login` | Sign in and set `df_session` and `df_csrf` cookies. |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/verify-email` | Verify an email token. |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/password/forgot` | Request a password reset. |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/password/reset` | Reset a password with a token. |
| GET | `/api/v1/auth/csrf` | Read the current CSRF token. |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/logout` | Sign out the current session. |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/logout-all` | Revoke all sessions for the current user. |
| GET | `/api/v1/auth/sessions` | List active sessions for the current user. |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/auth/sessions/:id` | Revoke one session. |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/password/change` | Change the current user's password. |

## Health and capabilities

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/healthz` | Process liveness. |
| GET | `/ready` | Readiness: Mastra / builtins finished; response includes `startup_ms` and `phases`. |
| GET | `/api/v1/capabilities` | Read backend capability switches. |
| GET | `/api/v1/me` | Read current identity. |

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/healthz
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/ready
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/v1/capabilities
```

## Agent Runtime

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/copilotkit` | Start an agent run; returns AG-UI event stream. |
| POST | `/api/v1/runs/:id/cancel` | Cancel a running agent run. |

`POST /api/copilotkit` uses CopilotKit / AG-UI `RunAgentInput`. See [Agent Runtime and AG-UI reference](agent-runtime.md).

## Sessions

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/sessions` | List server sessions. Supports `limit`, `cursor`. |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/sessions/:sessionId` | Update session title. |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/sessions/:sessionId` | Permanently delete a session and its conversation, runs, artifacts, and child branches. |
| GET | `/api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/conversation` | Read authoritative server conversation history. Supports `limit`. |
| GET | `/api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/checkpoints` | List persisted context checkpoints. Supports `limit`. |
| GET | `/api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/trace-dag` | Read the semantic run/step/tool/output graph. Supports `limit`. |
| POST | `/api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/branches` | Create a persistent branch from an ended run or checkpoint. Body: `{ "runId": "..." }` or `{ "checkpointId": "..." }`. |
| GET | `/api/v1/checkpoints/:checkpointId` | Read checkpoint metadata. |
| GET | `/api/v1/checkpoints/:checkpointId/context-package` | Read checkpoint metadata and its context snapshot. |

Session APIs restore history for Web/TUI, display titles, read tool-call pairings, and support re-asking from checkpoints. The `conversation` response includes `messages`, `runEventRefs`, `toolCalls`, and may include `checkpoints`, `branch`, and `branches`. Each checkpoint is derived from existing run, message, and run-event records and includes `runId`, `status`, message position bounds, event seq bounds, start/finish times, and optional error text; it marks the recoverable history boundary for one run. Branch sessions reference parent history up to the fork checkpoint instead of copying messages, so reading a branch returns the visible parent prefix plus the branch's own messages.

## Workspace configuration

| PATCH | `/api/v1/workspace-config` | Update default enablement. |

## Data Link

These routes proxy a compatible Data Link or DataGraph MCP resource configured in the current workspace. They do not provide an embedded graph service.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/datalink/servers` | List compatible configured servers. |
| GET | `/api/v1/datalink/:serverId/graph` | Read and normalize the workspace graph. |
| POST | `/api/v1/datalink/:serverId/explore` | Explore the graph from a natural-language query. |

| DELETE | `/api/v1/datalink/:serverId/tables/:tableId` | Remove a table through the configured service. |
| POST | `/api/v1/datalink/:serverId/rebuild` | Rebuild the external graph. |

`/api/v1/datagraph/*` is accepted as an alias for `/api/v1/datalink/*`.

## Write conventions

- Default JSON body limit is 1 MiB.
- `PATCH` supports optimistic concurrency with `revision` or `If-Match`.
- Schema fetch, index rebuild, and artifact export may use `Idempotency-Key`.
- Credentials are submitted only when creating or updating resources.
- Read APIs do not return plaintext passwords, tokens, or full connection strings.
